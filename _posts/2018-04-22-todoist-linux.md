Hey everyone.

I thoght it should be good idea to have Todoist opened as an application instead of tab in a browser.

Todoist supports a lot of different platforms but not Linux.
So I've made Electron wrapper for Todoist's web version.

[Here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/jzi5g7narop1e83/todoist-linux.zip?dl=0) you can download the latest build and [here](https://github.com/KryDos/todoist-linux/releases) you can find all releases.

Here is the [Github](https://github.com/KryDos/todoist-linux) page of the project.

Let me know about bugs or features you want to see in the project.
