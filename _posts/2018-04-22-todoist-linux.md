description: Todoist for linux, tray and global keybingins
---

Hey everyone.

I thoght it should be good idea to have Todoist opened as an application instead of tab in a browser.

Todoist supports a lot of different platforms but not Linux.
So I've made Electron wrapper for Todoist's web version.

The main reason why I couldn't use it as a web version is lack of global keybingins.

Current keybing supported:

* CTRL+ALT+a - quick add a task

Actually this is the only keybining I need. If you need anything else let me know.

Currently there are DEB and RPM packages:

* [DEB (Ubuntu/Debian/Mint/etc...)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ldv7uf5dxmerqx8/Todoist.deb?dl=0)
* [RPM (Fedora/Suse/etc...)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q8m6rxp26bjmfnh/Todoist.rpm?dl=0)

You can also download zip archive with executable [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/jzi5g7narop1e83/todoist-linux.zip?dl=0). It should work on any linux.

Here is the [Github](https://github.com/KryDos/todoist-linux) page of the project.

Let me know about bugs or features you want to see in the project.
