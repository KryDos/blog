Hi,
My name is Ruslan and I’m not really sociable (clap clap clap).

I decided to have a blog where I can write something about my experience and tools/languages I use. Probably, it should help me to be more social.

My current experience is mostly about PHP and backend-related development. I also have experience with many other programming languages (Rust, Go, Clojure, Ruby…) but I don’t think I know enough about them. So it would be great to improve my knowledge about them by researching and posting my thoughts here.

Another reason of this blog is to make my writing skill better, plus have better English (it’s not my first language).

Lets check where it will lead…
