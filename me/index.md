Hey everyone.

This is the site where I keep every kind of notes I consider useful.

Initially, it supposed to be a blog with cool long articles, but it turned out I feel comfortable with another format.

I really hope these notes may be helpful for other people as well.


If you have any questions/suggestions feel free to leave a comments in blog posts.
