My blog made with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted with Github Pages.
Since I took this template from getmicah.github.io I hope he will not be mind :3

## how to run

jekyll config has `vendor` and `packages` folders excluded.

Install gems with `bundle install --path=./packages`

Run jekyll with `bundle exec jekyll serve`

If on windows use `--force_polling` option to make `watch` working
